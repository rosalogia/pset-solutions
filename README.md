## Update: 11/11/2020

As of yesterday, the RUCS24 Discord server has moved toward a system of regular practice that involves posting
a problem on [Hackerrank](https://hackerrank.com) every other day, and sharing solutions the following day.
Canonical solutions to the problems along with explanations of how to solve them will be posted here.
